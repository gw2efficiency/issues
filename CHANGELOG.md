- *Supporters & Contributors:* Update the list of supporters

---

### 2018-07-12

**Bugfixes**

- *Account/Value:* Update the item value calculation to handle price manipulations better
  - *The item value calculation now ignores the sell price of an item if it is likely to be inflated (low supply, sell price is a lot higher than buy price, buy price is fairly low and the difference between the prices is substantial). This currently impacts around 1300 items and will not make a difference for 99% of users.*
  - *The change was required because a player gamed the system to get to the top of the leaderboard. They created about 270 of a craftable item, which had no supply on the tradingpost. They then proceeded to list that item for 10,000 gold, making gw2efficiency believe the value of this item to be 10,000 gold. In effect, this inflated the value of their account by about 2,700,000 gold.*

  - *The account statistic history of free users will be displayed going back 1 year. For supporters there is no limit. However, the statistics of free users will continue to be saved past 1 year, so once their accounts are upgraded they will have access to the full history.*

**Bugfixes**

- *Account/Statistics:* Crawl accounts only once per time frame
  - *Previously, all keys of each game account got crawled once per timeframe and then merged to calculate the leaderboard rank. This could cause spikes in the history of certain statistics if the permissions of the keys were different and was a major cause of server strain. Now each account only gets crawled once, with the key that has the best permissions for account statistic generation. This also means that adding multiple API keys no longer increases the crawling frequency.*
